#########################################BUILD INSTRUCTIONS#########################################

1) open ~/patchers/main/SONORIUM.maxpat preferably with MaxMSP 6.1.2 32-bit mode

2) move the file /patchers/main/sonorium_presets.json to the garbage (so that Max doesn't include it automatically when building the application, since it will read from another preset file)

3) go to Max menu and click "File > Build Collective/Application"

4) click the "open script" button and load ~/misc/build_script.txt and build the application into the ~/_final build_/ folder 

5) double-click the application and press "Show Package Contents", then move the files inside ~/_final build_/_add to contents_/ into the application contents. You may then delete the folder ~/_final build_/_add to contents_/ 

6) change the name of ~/final build/ to match sonorium's version (ex: Sonorium 1.0)

7) move the application folder somewhere to the hard-drive (ex: into the applications folder)

8) and finally edit preset files (.json) inside sonorium_presets folder, to match the file paths (audio and matrix files) in your hard-drive, and you're ready to run the app
